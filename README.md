## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Why
WordWise was created to **improve writing clarity, correctness, and confidence** in real time.

---

## 8. System Workflow

1. **User Inputs Text** – Typed directly into the editor
2. **Grammar Analysis** – Backend processes text
3. **Suggestions Returned** – Highlighted in real time
4. **Analytics Updated** – Charts reflect writing metrics
5. **Offline Mode** – Mini-game activates if server is unavailable

---

## 9. API & Stability

* Rate limiting enforced via **Flask-Limiter**
* CORS configured for frontend-backend communication
* Serverless-compatible request handling

---

## 10. Limitations

* Single-user workflow (no accounts)
* Dependency on external grammar API
* No persistent history tracking yet
* Web-only interface (no mobile app)

---

## 11. Usage Example

```text
User types paragraph →
Errors highlighted →
Suggestions shown →
Analytics update in dashboard
```

During downtime:

```text
Server offline →
Word Catcher game activates
```
